# Auto Shutdown

Remade a school program that shuts down a computer automatically after 300 seconds


Features:
- Simple and Symmetric Design
- Lightweight program design and size
- Ability to stop the shutdown from happening
- Shut down a computer easily as it is automatic
- You can modify the time for this program (by re-compiling with the following changes)
	- Change the 'Maximum' for the progress bar
	- Change the 'int secondsTillShutdown' variable value to fit another number
	- Change the text of the shutdown label to set whatever number of seconds you want

Usage:
- Server Network/Computer Owners: Run this file on all computers when they need to be shutdown
- Other users: This can be used as a prank to shut down another users computer by loading it through a drive or something

Notes:
- I am NOT responsible for any damage done to anyone or anything from use of the program beyond its intended usage
- I did not put a credit button on this program as it seems useless
